# printf Project

## Description
This project is an implementation of the `printf` function, which is used to produce formatted output in C programs. The goal of this project is to replicate the behavior of the `printf` function found in the C Standard Library, and to understand how it works under the hood.

## Features
- Handle basic formats like `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, and `%%`.
- Implement variable argument lists and manage memory effectively.
- Provide custom formatting options for printing integers, characters, strings, and more.

## Authors
- **Yoruan Orta**
- **Joan Martinez**

To compile the project, you can use the following command:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c -o printf
